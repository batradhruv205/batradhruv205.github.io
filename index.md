# Dhruv's GitHub

## Who am I and what is this about?
I'm a 23 year old with a Finance degree who seems to enjoy coding a little more than stock-valuations. So, I chose to keep picking up tech skills as a hobby (for now, at least) and puttin up things on my GitHub so I can put up a good show! 
Through this blog, you can see all the projects that I have done sprinkled with my thoughts and ideas about them.
