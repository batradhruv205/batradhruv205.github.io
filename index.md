## Who am I and what is this about?
I'm a 23 year old with a Finance degree who seems to enjoy coding a little more than stock-valuations. So, I chose to keep picking up tech skills as a hobby (for now, at least) and puttin up things on my GitHub so I can put up a good show! 
Through this blog, you can see all the projects that I have done sprinkled with my thoughts and ideas about them.

## PROJECTS

### Project 1: FinTech Gang - Natural Language Processing
Excuse the name - this was a school project and we were forced to choose 'cool' names for our groups. This task was done as a class project for a course on Natural Language Processing for Finance. 
The project was quite open-ended and left to us students to figure out. For us finance students, the first thing on our minds is always the stock market. And so, we felt that the project had to be somehow related to the stock market. But, we did not want to simply run a sentiment analysis on Trump's tweets and look at stock movements - we wanted to do something slightly off the usual.
