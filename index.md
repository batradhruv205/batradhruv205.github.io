# A finance student's journey into tech

## Who am I and what is this about?

I'm a 23 year old with a Finance degree who seems to enjoy coding a little more than stock-valuations. So, I chose to keep picking up tech skills as a hobby (for now, at least) and writing about my projects on this GitHub Blog so I can put up a good show! 
Through this blog, you can see all the projects that I have done sprinkled with my thoughts and ideas about them.

## PROJECTS

### Project 1: FinTech Gang - Natural Language Processing

Excuse the name - this was a school project and we were forced to choose 'cool' names for our groups. This task was done as a class project for a course on Natural Language Processing for Finance. 

The project was quite open-ended and left to us students to figure out. For us finance students, the first thing on our minds is always the stock market. And so, we felt that the project had to be somehow related to the stock market. But, we did not want to simply run a sentiment analysis on Trump's tweets and look at stock movements - we wanted to do something slightly off the usual.

Our project was focused on looking at a very common topic within finance – Earnings Releases. The usual analysis in this area is the semantic analysis of speeches and statements of senior executives of a firm to predict the said firm's upcoming earnings. We chose to leave this part to individual investors, and instead, analyze opinions of investors on certain social media platforms. The underlying idea was that markets are mostly efficient in the manner that publicly available information is consumed by individual investors without much time-lag. Consequently, the combined view of all investors should be a good indicator of the agregate market prediction. The proxy for investor opinions were chosen to be posts on Twitter, StockTwits, and Reddit regarding the firms' performance. 

Such a study implied the potential removal of the need for an investor to collect a large number of sources that may provide insights into the earnings releases of a firm. It restricted information sources to just a few and in a manner, crowd-sourced information. 

The focus of the project was on predicting earnings __surprises__ – the over or underperformance as compared to market expectation – using textual data from Twitter, StockTwits and Reddit.
